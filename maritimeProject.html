      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project focuses on analyzing and predicting vessel trajectories using real-world data collected from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) antenna located at the University of Piraeus. The primary objective is to enhance our understanding of vessel movements in the Saronic Bay area and develop predictive models that can forecast ship trajectories based on historical AIS data. This process is split into five main phases: Database Setup and Data Collection, Data Exploration and Queries, Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering, Model Development, and Model Evaluation.</p>

            <p>The first step was to establish a spatial database to store the raw AIS data that we would be working with. This database, called <span class="highlight">thalassaDB</span>, was designed to handle large volumes of vessel data and enable efficient spatial queries for analysis. AIS data, which includes vessel position, speed, course, and timestamp, was collected from the AIS antenna located at the University of Piraeus.</p>
            <p>In this phase, we also focused on velocity filtering, ensuring that only vessels in motion were considered for analysis. This step was important because we wanted to eliminate data related to stationary vessels or erroneous GPS readings.</p>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>With the data collected and stored in the database, we began exploring it through SQL queries. This phase involved performing basic queries to explore the vessel information, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Vessel ID and names</li>
              <li>Speed and course of movement</li>
              <li>Distances between vessels and ports</li>
              <li>Port entry and exit times</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also manually added additional data like port locations and geometries, and performed geospatial queries to extract insights from spatial relationships between vessels and ports.</p>
            <p><strong>Example Questions Answered:</strong> "Which vessels are currently within a 10 km radius of Piraeus Port?" or "What is the average speed of vessels within a certain distance from the shore?"</p>

            <p>This was the most complex and critical phase, where we addressed errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the raw AIS data. Key tasks included:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Temporal and Speed Consistency</strong>: We applied rolling averages to smooth the speed data and removed records where the speed exceeded realistic limits for each vessel type.</li>
              <li><strong>Spatial Cleaning with R-tree Indexing</strong>: Using R-tree indexing, we filtered out erroneous spatial data points (e.g., vessels traveling several hundred kilometers within a single timestamp).</li>
              <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Vessel statuses were categorized based on operational conditions like speed and type, and the data was split into trips and trajectories.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We also handled missing data through linear interpolation to ensure continuous vessel trajectories.</p>
