    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on analyzing and predicting vessel trajectories using real-world AIS data collected from the University of Piraeus. The primary objective is to enhance our understanding of vessel movements in the Saronic Bay area and develop predictive models that can forecast ship trajectories based on historical AIS data. This process is split into five main phases: Database Setup and Data Collection, Data Exploration and Queries, Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering, Model Development, and Model Evaluation.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="database">
        <h2>1. Database Setup and Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The first step was to establish a spatial database to store the raw AIS data that we would be working with. This database, called thalassaDB, was designed to handle large volumes of vessel data and enable efficient spatial queries for analysis. AIS data, which includes vessel position, speed, course, and timestamp, was collected from the AIS antenna located at the University of Piraeus. The data tracked vessels in the Saronic Bay area, with a focus on passenger vessels, which frequently visited the nearby Piraeus Port.</p>
        <p>In this phase, we also focused on velocity filtering, ensuring that only vessels in motion were considered for analysis. This step was important because we wanted to eliminate data related to vessels that were stationary or had erroneous GPS readings, ensuring that our analysis would reflect only meaningful, real-time movement data.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-exploration">
        <h2>2. Data Exploration and Geospatial Queries</h2>
        <p>With the data collected and stored in the database, we began exploring it through SQL queries. This phase involved performing basic queries to explore the vessel information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vessel ID and names</li>
            <li>Speed and course of movement</li>
            <li>Distances between vessels and ports</li>
            <li>Port entry and exit times</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also began performing geospatial queries to extract insights from the spatial relationship between vessels and ports. For example, using SQL and spatial functions, we could answer questions such as: "Which vessels are currently within a 10 km radius of Piraeus Port?" or "What is the average speed of vessels within a certain distance from the shore?"</p>
    </section>

    <section id="data-cleaning">
        <h2>3. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>Data cleaning was the most complex and critical phase in the project. Since the raw data was prone to errors, inconsistencies, and missing values, it was essential to clean and prepare it before it could be used in the machine learning models. This phase involved:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Temporal and Speed Consistency:</strong> We applied rolling averages to smooth the speed data and filtered out unrealistic speed values.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Cleaning with R-tree Indexing:</strong> We used R-tree spatial indexing to efficiently clean erroneous spatial data points.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Vessel statuses were classified based on operational conditions like speed, type, and port associations.</li>
            <li><strong>Handling Missing Data:</strong> Linear interpolation was used to fill gaps in missing position data.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="model">
        <h2>4. Model Development</h2>
        <p>After preparing the data, we focused on building a neural network model capable of predicting vessel trajectories. We chose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture, particularly a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, due to its effectiveness in handling sequential and time-dependent data.</p>
