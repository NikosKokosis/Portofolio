            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project involved analyzing and modeling a dataset containing over 2.8 million traffic accident records in the U.S. from February 2016 to December 2021. 
                A random sample of 100,000 records was selected for detailed analysis, focusing on clustering and classification tasks using machine learning techniques. 
                The primary aim was to uncover patterns in the data and predict accident severity levels based on relevant features.

            <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
            <p>To ensure quality and usability, the data underwent extensive preprocessing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sampling and Balancing:</strong> The sample was stratified to include 25,000 records for each of the four severity categories (1–4).</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Selected features included Severity, Duration, Start_Lat, Start_Lon and weather attributes.</li>
                <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Null values in numerical features were imputed using the median grouped by city, while categorical features were dropped or transformed.</li>
                <li><strong>Outlier Removal:</strong> Outliers were removed, improving the dataset's quality for analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                Regarding the dataset used, it was observed from the statistical analysis that there was an abundance of observations related to Severity category 2. To avoid this imbalance in our observations, we proceeded with random sampling to achieve an equal distribution of 25,000 observations in each Severity category. The statistical analysis concluded that most observations had a duration of up to 3 hours, and the distance of most accidents did not exceed 0.5 miles. Therefore, we attempted to reclassify our dataset based on geography and weather conditions using clustering, while also looking for potential correlations between the new categories and the duration and distance of the accidents. We drew useful conclusions, such as that the western USA experiences accidents of shorter duration and distance. Finally, we examined a classification problem in our dataset. By utilizing the most significant data after the necessary preprocessing steps, we attempted to train a machine that, when provided with this data, would classify our observations into the corresponding Severity category. This attempt was made with two machines: a neural network and LinearSVC, with the neural network yielding better results, successfully predicting 76% of the observations.
