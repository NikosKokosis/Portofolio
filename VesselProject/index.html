    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on analyzing and predicting vessel trajectories using real-world data collected from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) antenna located at the University of Piraeus. The primary objective is to enhance our understanding of vessel movements in the Saronic Bay area and develop predictive models that can forecast ship trajectories based on historical AIS data. The process is split into five main phases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Database Setup and Data Collection</li>
            <li>Data Exploration and Queries</li>
            <li>Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering</li>
            <li>Model Development</li>
            <li>Model Evaluation</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="database-setup">
        <h2>Section 1: Database Setup and Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The first step was to establish a spatial database called <strong>thalassaDB</strong> to store raw AIS data. The data tracked vessels in the Saronic Bay area, focusing on passenger vessels visiting Piraeus Port. The AIS data includes vessel IDs, locations, time stamps, speed, and other movement details, making it ideal for trajectory prediction.</p>
        <p>Key tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Designed the database schema to store large volumes of AIS data efficiently, using PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for spatial data.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Collected AIS data using the University of Piraeusâ€™ AIS antenna, focusing on vessel movements near the Saronic Bay area and Piraeus Port.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Filtering:</strong> Filtered out irrelevant data, focusing on vessels that are in motion to ensure accurate analysis.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="data-exploration">
        <h2>Section 2: Data Exploration and Geospatial Queries</h2>
        <p>After the data was collected and stored in the database, we conducted a detailed exploration using SQL queries to extract key vessel information, such as vessel IDs, speed, course, and distances between vessels and ports. This phase was critical in identifying trends and relationships within the data.</p>
        <p>Key tasks included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Port Geospatial Data Integration:</strong> Enhanced the database with port locations and geometries to allow for spatial analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Queries:</strong> Used spatial queries to identify vessels within a specific distance from Piraeus Port, such as "Which vessels are within 10 km of Piraeus Port?"</li>
            <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Examined the temporal patterns of vessel movements, such as peak times for vessel arrivals and departures.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="data-cleaning">
        <h2>Section 3: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering</h2>
        <p>Data cleaning was crucial in ensuring the quality of the data before feeding it into the model. We addressed several inconsistencies, including temporal gaps, erroneous GPS points, and unrealistic speed values. Feature engineering was also performed to better capture vessel behaviors and trajectories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temporal Consistency:</strong> Applied rolling averages to smooth the speed data and removed any unrealistic speed values caused by erroneous GPS readings.</li>
            <li><strong>Spatial Data Cleaning:</strong> Used R-tree indexing to filter out erroneous GPS points and ensure accurate vessel positions, enhancing the spatial accuracy of the trajectories.</li>
            <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Developed features such as vessel speed, heading, and distance to ports, and categorized vessel statuses (e.g., moored, underway). Created mini-trajectories by dividing long trajectories into shorter segments to make the model more efficient.</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

    <section id="mini-trajectories">
        <h2>Section 4: Mini-Trajectories and Feature Preparation for Neural Network Training</h2>
        <p>To optimize model training, continuous vessel trajectories were split into mini-trajectories. Each mini-trajectory represented a small time window and captured both short-term and long-term movement patterns. This step was crucial in improving the efficiency and accuracy of the neural network models.</p>
        <p>Each mini-trajectory consisted of 14 time steps, which was a suitable trade-off between capturing meaningful movement patterns and reducing the complexity of the dataset. Additionally, the features were normalized using Min-Max scaling to ensure that all features contributed equally to the model.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="model-development">
        <h2>Section 5: Model Development and Training</h2>
        <p>For this project, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was chosen due to its effectiveness in sequential data prediction tasks, such as vessel trajectory forecasting. LSTM models are able to capture long-range dependencies and temporal relationships in time-series data, making them ideal for this type of analysis.</p>
        <p>The model was trained using the prepared mini-trajectories, and hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden layers were tuned to improve performance. The training data was split into training and validation sets to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="model-evaluation">
        <h2>Section 6: Model Evaluation</h2>
        <p>After training the LSTM model, the next step was to evaluate its performance. The model's accuracy was measured using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), a common metric for regression tasks. The RMSE for the vessel trajectory prediction model was 23.21 meters, meaning that on average, the predicted vessel positions were within 23.21 meters of the true positions.</p>
        <p>This result highlights the model's strong predictive power in dynamic maritime environments. Additional metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared were also computed to evaluate the model's robustness across different vessel types and movement patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Section 7: Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrated how the combination of data cleaning, spatial algorithms, and machine learning can significantly enhance vessel trajectory forecasting. By leveraging AIS data and advanced neural networks, we developed a predictive model capable of accurately forecasting vessel movements in the Saronic Bay area. The model's success can have a significant impact on the maritime industry, aiding in route optimization, port management, and safety planning.</p>
        <p>The techniques applied in this project are scalable and could be extended to other maritime regions or even different types of vehicles, showcasing the potential for broader applications in transportation forecasting and logistics.</p>
