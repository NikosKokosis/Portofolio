        <h1>Airbnb Price Analysis in Berlin</h1>
        <p>Exploring the Impact of Room Types, Hosts, and Seasonal Trends on Pricing</p>

    <div class="container">
        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project analyzes Airbnb listings in Berlin, focusing on the factors that influence pricing. The primary variables of interest are room type, host type (Superhost vs. Non-Superhost) and seasonal trends. By understanding how these factors impact rental prices, we aim to uncover key insights that can help both guests and hosts make informed decisions. The dataset spans listings from 2019 to 2023, offering a comprehensive view of the market over a multi-year period.</p>

        <section id="price-room-type">
            <h2>Price vs Room Type Analysis</h2>
            <p>We analyzed the relationship between room type and price over a timeline from October 2019 to March 2023. Our findings show distinct trends in pricing across the four Airbnb accommodation categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entire homes/apartments</strong> consistently had the highest prices, offering a sense of luxury and privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Private rooms</strong> remained affordable, providing a balance of comfort and cost-effectiveness for travelers.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared rooms</strong> were the most economical choice, appealing to budget-conscious travelers.</li>
                <li><strong>Hotel rooms</strong> exhibited a wider variance in prices, making them an unpredictable but sometimes competitive option.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="data-story">The timeline reveals how external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, significantly influenced pricing and demand. From April 2020 to July 2020, there was a noticeable decline in prices for entire homes/apartments and private rooms, reflecting the drop in demand during the initial outbreak. A moderate recovery began in summer 2020 as restrictions eased, followed by another decline between November 2020 and August 2021 due to the pandemic's resurgence.</p>
            <p class="data-story">By mid-2021, demand and prices surged, especially for entire homes/apartments, as travel resumed. This price increase likely made shared rooms and some hotel rooms more attractive alternatives. The trend highlights how guests adjusted to higher prices by opting for more economical or newly introduced options, such as hotel rooms, while hosts adapted to changing market conditions.</p>
            <p class="data-story">Our analysis underscores the evolving landscape of Airbnb accommodations in Berlin and the broader impact of external events on traveler behavior and pricing strategies.</p>

            <h2>Room Type Distribution</h2>
            <p>Our analysis of Airbnb listings reveals the distribution of room types available in the Berlin market. The majority of accommodations fall into the "Entire home/apartment" category, with smaller proportions for other room types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entire homes/apartments:</strong> 64.69% of listings, making it the most common choice for travelers seeking privacy and full control of the space.</li>
                <li><strong>Private rooms:</strong> 33.14% of listings, providing a comfortable and budget-friendly option while sharing a property with the host or other guests.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared rooms:</strong> 1.21% of listings, catering to travelers with a tight budget, offering the most economical stay option.</li>
                <li><strong>Hotel rooms:</strong> 0.96% of listings, a newer addition to the platform, offering a mix of traditional hotel amenities and Airbnb flexibility.</li>

            <p class="data-story">These proportions highlight the dominance of entire homes/apartments in Airbnb's offerings, reflecting a preference for fully independent stays. Private rooms also hold a significant share, appealing to travelers balancing cost and comfort. Shared rooms and hotel rooms, while less common, provide niche options for budget-conscious travelers and those seeking hotel-like experiences within the Airbnb ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Host Type and Listing Availability</h2>
            <p>Our analysis highlights key differences in listing availability between Superhosts and Non-Superhosts, focusing on the correlation between host type and availability days. Two histograms were generated to better visualize the values after one day of availability, as zero availability days dominate the counts, making it challenging to display other trends clearly.</p>
            <p>The findings reveal that Superhosts generally have fewer available days compared to Non-Superhosts, reflecting the higher demand for their listings. This is particularly evident in the initial bar of the plots, where a significant number of Non-Superhost listings have zero availability days. This suggests that many Non-Superhosts may close their listings due to unfavorable conditions or low traveler demand.</p>

            <div class="chart-container">
                <div class="chart">
                    <h3>Availability Days by Host Type</h3>
                    <img src="../images/projects/airbnbs/availabilityDaysHistogram.png" alt="Availability Days by Host Type" style="width: 100%; cursor: pointer;" onclick="enlargeImage(this)">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="data-story">As we examine availability days across different ranges, a few patterns emerge:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low availability (1-80 days):</strong> Non-Superhosts consistently outnumber Superhosts, suggesting a scarcity of Superhosts in Berlin and higher availability for last-minute travelers.</li>
                <li><strong>Medium availability (80-220 days):</strong> The distribution becomes more balanced between the two categories, indicating similar activity levels for medium-term bookings.</li>
                <li><strong>High availability (220-365 days):</strong> A growing disparity is observed, with an increasing number of Non-Superhost listings compared to Superhosts. In the last bar (330-365 days), the gap is most pronounced, with approximately 1000 Non-Superhost listings versus only 100 Superhost listings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="data-story">These trends reflect the logical pattern of higher demand for Superhosts, whose proven track record attracts travelers. Superhost listings are likely to close earlier as they reach their maximum availability. Conversely, Non-Superhost listings remain more widely available throughout the year, offering flexibility for last-minute bookings.</p>
            <p class="data-story">Overall, this analysis underscores the strong correlation between host type and listing availability, illustrating how traveler preferences shape booking patterns in the Berlin Airbnb market.</p>

            <h2>Top Listings by Ratings and Reviews</h2>
            <p>To identify the finest listings, we analyzed hosts based on their total ratings and the number of reviews. To ensure a fair evaluation, we applied filters that included only hosts with more than 500 reviews and an average of at least 10 reviews per month. These filters helped us focus on the most popular and consistently rated properties.</p>
            <p>Our findings highlight several standout hosts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numa | Nook</strong>: Achieved the highest average rating of 4.81, showcasing its consistent ability to exceed guest expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Numa | Drift (Ex. Gaijin)</strong>: With an impressive rating of 4.80 and 1622 reviews, it stands as one of the most popular choices for travelers.</li>
                <li><strong>Stayery</strong>: Received a strong average rating of 4.75, combining unique offerings with positive guest feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Nena Apartments Metropolpark Berlin</strong>: The most reviewed host with 1806 reviews, indicating immense popularity among travelers.</li>

            <h2>Price Trends for Nena vs. Numa</h2>
            <p>We analyzed pricing trends for Nena and Numa, two prominent Airbnb hosts in Berlin, using calendar data from 2023. The analysis highlights differences in their pricing strategies and seasonal variations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Numa:</strong> Maintains higher average prices, catering to a premium market with fewer fluctuations.</li>
                <li><strong>Nena:</strong> Exhibits significant seasonality, with prices peaking during high-demand periods such as June to September and specific events in late September.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="data-story">This comparison reveals that Numa targets travelers seeking high-end accommodations, while Nena adjusts pricing dynamically based on demand, making it a more budget-conscious choice. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Between June and September 2023, Nena displayed noticeable price increases aligned with peak tourist seasons.</li>
                <li>Both companies experienced a sharp price surge in the second half of September, potentially due to major events or festivals in Berlin.</li>

Other central neighborhoods like Frankfurter Allee Süd FK (638), Tempelhofer Vorstadt (593) and Brunnenstr. Süd (496) also have significant numbers. In contrast, more peripheral areas, such as Marzahn-Nord (1), Neu-Hohenschönhausen Süd (2), and Malchow (2), have fewer listings.
