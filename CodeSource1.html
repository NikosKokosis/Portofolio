            <p>
                This project examines wildfire occurrences in Greece from 2012 to 2016, focusing on patterns in frequency, burned area, 
                and duration across regions. Through data-driven insights, the analysis uncovers key factors impacting wildfire behavior 
                and provides actionable recommendations for disaster preparedness and response.

            <h2>Wildfire Trends by Year</h2>
            <p>
                The annual distribution of wildfires reveals significant fluctuations:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>2012:</strong> The highest wildfire incidents (24% of total), highlighting critical conditions and increased risk.</li>
                    <li><strong>2016:</strong> A resurgence in wildfire activity (22.2%), reversing the decline seen in 2014–2015.</li>
                    <li><strong>2014–2015:</strong> Notable reduction, potentially due to preventive measures implemented after 2012.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> Consistent monitoring and intervention strategies are crucial to sustaining reductions in wildfire incidents. 
                The cyclical nature of wildfire trends underscores the need for long-term solutions.

        <section id="seasonal" class="content-section">
            <h2>Seasonal Trends in Wildfire Incidents</h2>
            <p>
                The temporal distribution of wildfires demonstrates strong seasonal patterns:
                <ul>
                    <li>Peak incidents occur during <strong>July and August</strong>, with August consistently exhibiting the highest numbers.</li>
                    <li>Spring and autumn months show lower activity, though isolated spikes occur in October (notably in the islands).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> Resource allocation should prioritize summer months, especially August, to address peak demand. 
                The October spikes suggest a need for regional-specific preparedness plans.

        <section id="geospatial" class="content-section">
            <h2>Geospatial Patterns of Wildfires</h2>
            <p>
                Spatial analysis highlights wildfire hotspots:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Central Greece:</strong> Consistently high wildfire incidents and burned land.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thessaly:</strong> Extensive damage in short durations, indicating response inefficiencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Northern Aegean Islands:</strong> Increased activity in autumn, particularly October.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> High-risk regions like Central Greece and Thessaly require improved response strategies. Effective containment in the Ionian Islands demonstrates best practices that can be replicated.

        <section id="duration" class="content-section">
            <h2>Duration and Severity of Wildfires</h2>
            <p>
                Fire duration and severity were assessed across regions:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thessaly:</strong> High burned areas in short durations suggest delays in containment measures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sterea Ellada:</strong> Prolonged durations but less burned area compared to Thessaly, indicating better fire management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Peloponnese:</strong> Moderate burned areas despite long durations, reflecting effective resource use.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> Rapid response strategies are essential for regions like Thessaly to reduce burned areas. 
                The Peloponnese's resource efficiency should be studied and adopted in other regions.

        <section id="factors" class="content-section">
            <h2>Correlation Between Wildfires and External Factors</h2>
            <p>
                A correlation matrix was used to examine relationships between wildfire severity and influencing factors:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> Minimal impact; most wildfires occurred during predictable summer weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Resources:</strong> Firefighter deployment (moderate correlation) significantly reduced fire durations. Aerial support (helicopters, planes) was particularly effective in minimizing burned areas.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> Investment in human and aerial resources yields measurable benefits in reducing wildfire severity. 
                Weather’s limited influence reinforces the importance of proactive firefighting measures.

            <p>
                The innovative metric <strong>Burned Area per Minute</strong> was developed to predict high-risk periods:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>July and August 2017:</strong> Forecasted spikes in wildfire activity, with burned areas expected to peak at 442.5 hectares/minute.</li>
                    <li><strong>Larissa:</strong> Emerged as the highest-risk region, requiring focused monitoring and resource allocation.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Insights:</strong> Predictive analytics enables efficient resource allocation during critical periods. 
                High-risk regions like Larissa should serve as priority zones for disaster preparedness.
